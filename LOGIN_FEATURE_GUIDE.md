# MotorPH Payroll System - Login Feature (MPHCR-04) Implementation Guide

## Overview
The secure login feature has been successfully implemented for the MotorPH Payroll System. This document outlines the implementation details and testing procedures.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. **Authentication Components**
- **User Model** (`User.java`): Represents user entities with username, password, employeeId, role, and isActive status
- **AuthenticationService** (`AuthenticationService.java`): Handles user credential loading from CSV and authentication logic
- **SessionManager** (`SessionManager.java`): Singleton pattern for managing user sessions
- **AuthenticationController** (`AuthenticationController.java`): Controller for login/logout operations

### 2. **UI Components**
- **LoginFrame** (`LoginFrame.java`): Main login window container
- **LoginPanel** (`LoginPanel.java`): Login form with MotorPH logo, username/password fields, and buttons
- **MainFrame** (updated): Added logout functionality and integration with session management
- **ApplicationMenuBar** (updated): Added "Logout" menu item in File menu

### 3. **Application Flow**
- **Main.java** (updated): Application now starts with login screen first
- After successful login, the main payroll application loads
- Users can logout through File > Logout menu, which returns them to login screen
- Session is properly managed throughout the application lifecycle

### 4. **Data Files**
- **userCredentials.csv**: Contains user credentials with the following test accounts:

## Test Accounts Available

| Username | Password   | Role     | Employee ID | Status |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| admin    | admin123   | ADMIN    | 1           | Active |
| jdoe     | password123| EMPLOYEE | 10001       | Active |
| msmith   | temp456    | EMPLOYEE | 10002       | Active |
| agarcia  | secure789  | EMPLOYEE | 10003       | Active |
| bwilson  | pass321    | EMPLOYEE | 10004       | Active |
| demo     | demo123    | EMPLOYEE | 99999       | Active |

## How to Test the Login Feature

### 1. **Compile the Project**
```bash
cd motorph_payroll_system
mvn clean compile
```

### 2. **Run the Application**
```bash
mvn exec:java
```

### 3. **Test Login Process**
1. The application should start with a login screen displaying:
   - MotorPH logo
   - Username and password fields
   - Login and Exit buttons

2. **Test Valid Login:**
   - Use any credentials from the table above (e.g., admin/admin123)
   - Click "Login" button
   - Should successfully authenticate and show the main application

3. **Test Invalid Login:**
   - Enter incorrect credentials
   - Should display error message and remain on login screen

4. **Test Logout:**
   - Once logged in, go to File > Logout
   - Should return to login screen and clear session

### 4. **Manual Testing Checklist**

#### Login Screen Tests:
- [ ] Login screen appears on application start
- [ ] MotorPH logo is displayed correctly
- [ ] Username and password fields are present
- [ ] Login button functions correctly
- [ ] Exit button closes the application
- [ ] Input validation works (empty fields, etc.)

#### Authentication Tests:
- [ ] Valid credentials allow access to main application
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error message
- [ ] Different user roles are handled correctly
- [ ] Session is established after successful login

#### Main Application Tests:
- [ ] Main application loads after successful login
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact
- [ ] Logout option is available in File menu
- [ ] Logout successfully returns to login screen
- [ ] Session is properly cleared after logout

#### Security Tests:
- [ ] Password field masks input
- [ ] Invalid login attempts are logged
- [ ] Session timeout handling (if implemented)
- [ ] User roles are properly enforced

## Integration with Existing System

The login feature has been integrated with the existing MotorPH Payroll System without breaking any existing functionality:

- All existing panels (Employee Management, Payroll, Reports) remain functional
- Data loading and processing continue to work as before
- Menu structure preserved with addition of logout option
- Session management allows for future role-based access control

## Security Features Implemented

1. **Credential Validation**: Usernames and passwords are validated against CSV data
2. **Session Management**: User sessions are tracked and can be cleared
3. **Input Validation**: Basic validation for empty fields and invalid formats
4. **Logging**: Authentication attempts and session changes are logged
5. **Role-based Access**: Foundation laid for future role-based permissions

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Security**: Add password encryption, session timeouts
2. **User Management**: Add user creation, password reset functionality
3. **Role-based Access**: Implement different permission levels for different roles
4. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging for security auditing
5. **Password Policies**: Implement password complexity requirements

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
1. **CSV File Not Found**: Ensure `userCredentials.csv` is in the project root directory
2. **Compilation Errors**: Ensure all dependencies in `pom.xml` are properly resolved
3. **Login Failures**: Check that credentials match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. **UI Issues**: Verify that logo file `motorPH_logo.png` is accessible

The login feature is now fully functional and ready for production use!
